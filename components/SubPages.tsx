        We believe that access to primary education will help women address challenges pertaining to economic prosperity, physical security, healthcare, and social equality. Our initial focus will be women in Afghanistan, but we reserve the prospects to broaden our influence to other developing countries with time. We believe that educated women will prove to be the key ingredient in the revitalization of the underdeveloped world.

        Women Empowerment Through Education (WETE) is a Toronto-based non-profit organization that provides educational opportunities for women in poor communities. Our institution targets smaller villages all across the globe since these communities often lack the basic resources needed to operate schools, academies, or other educational facilities.

        To initiate our prophesy of educational development, we plan to establish and fund fully operated educational facilities in key areas of the developing world.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        Our operational strategy is organized in three main phases. These phases are created to provide a gradual growth of our reach and influence as we expand as an organization and establish a greater network.
      </p>

      <div className="my-10">
        <img 
          src="https://bokhariaircraftenterprises.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Add-this-image-after-the-paragraph-starting-from-22The-First-Two-phases.png" 
          alt="Project Structure Phases" 
          className="w-full h-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg border-4 border-white"
        />
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The first two phases will focus on smaller villages in Afghanistan because that is where our management team has the most cultural knowledge and expertise. As our resources grow, however, we will direct our attention to other communities across the globe that lack the basic opportunities for primary education. This, however, will unfold in the third phase.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-darkBlue mt-10 mb-4">Phase 1: Jalalabad, Afghanistan</h4>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Our first target is Jalalabad, Afghanistan, with an operational facility of: 1 unit manager, 1 legal consultant, 3 teachers, and 10 students. With success, this business model can be expanded to meet a higher demand of staff and students. With time, we can also acculturate this business model to meet the educational standards of other regions in the developing world. Our ultimate mission is to help spread access to primary education globally–specifically for women.
      </p>

      <div className="my-10">
        <img 
          src="https://wete.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_6448-2-scaled.jpg" 
          alt="Students in class" 
          className="w-full h-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg border-4 border-white"
        />
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Jalalabad is the 5th largest city in Afghanistan, but despite its size, it still inhabits an array of smaller communities where educational opportunities are scarce. To better provide educational opportunities for women in this region, we will offer primary education for women aged 14-45 years old.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        To combat cultural beliefs that dissuade women from pursuing educational careers, we will offer each student a monthly salary to compensate them for spending time in the educational facility. This will allow our female students to contribute financially to the household and, in turn, help support their families. With time, we hope this strategy will help persuade the Afghan patriarchy to realize the overwhelming benefits of empowering women in the workforce.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The students are expected to show up to class every day. In return, they will receive a stipend of $100/month for participation. This will entice greater interest for women to attend school in the region, and it will also provide an incentive for male citizens to support their female family members’ education. We will offer our students an educational facility, daily lectures, and a matriculated curriculum that will prepare them for prosperous lives in the Afghan society.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        We already have a building with staff ready to start our educational operations once we receive sufficient funding. To fully operate this facility for 12-months we estimate that $50,000 is needed. This fund will consist of staff salaries, student salaries, operational fees, logistical resources, and academic supplies. A more detailed overview is provided in the table below.
      </p>

      <div className="my-10">

          className="w-full h-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg border-4 border-white"
        />
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The calculations gained from salaries and facility rentals are based on contracts and agreements settled with our staff members and landlords in Afghanistan. The calculations related to materials, transportation, and utilities are based on information gained by our staff and representatives who either spent their childhoods in Afghanistan or are currently living in the country. All calculations overestimate the total cost of operations to account for unforeseen overage. Our estimated cost of $40,960 is a conservative calculation so we predict that $50,000 will be sufficient funding to operate the facility for 12 months even if unforeseen challenges arise.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-darkBlue mt-10 mb-4">Projected Timeline:</h4>
      
      <ul className="list-none space-y-4 pl-0 mb-6">
        <li className="pl-4 border-l-4 border-brand-teal">
          <strong>By the summer of 2022</strong>, we will construct a formal curriculum plan that allows us to start offering primary education level classes to women in the local region while adhering to local labor/education laws.
        </li>
        <li className="pl-4 border-l-4 border-brand-teal">
          <strong>By the fall of 2022</strong>, we hope to have enough revenue to operate independently via a steady flux of donations.
        </li>
        <li className="pl-4 border-l-4 border-brand-teal">
          <strong>By the spring of 2023</strong>, we hope to have enough monetary resources to sign a renting contract with a landlord in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, and thus acquire a building that serves as an educational facility.
        </li>
        <li className="pl-4 border-l-4 border-brand-teal">
          <strong>By the fall of 2023</strong>, our first class of 10 students will be enrolled in the education program and we will possess an on-site staff of 3 teachers, 1 legal affairs manager, and 1 facility manager.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Our goal is to operate the Jalalabad unit successfully for at least two academic years before we engage in further growth. In these two years, we will make appropriate assessments in terms of growing our class size, but we will not increase the number of educational facilities before we have demonstrated sufficient and steady managerial operations of the Jalalabad unit.

      <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-darkBlue mt-10 mb-4">Phase 2: Other Communities in Afghanistan</h4>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If we can showcase sufficient and steady managerial operations of the Jalalabad unit for at least two consecutive years, we will acculturate our organizational operations to enter other communities in Afghanistan. We will utilize the systems, networks, and resources obtained since our conception to raise funds for additional educational facilities. We will again target poor communities in Afghanistan to provide even greater access to primary education in this region.
